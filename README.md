# Kotlin Modding Skeleton
Provides an example mod written in Kotlin using Kotlin for Forge.

Basic block and item creation with ore generation and addition to creative mode tab.

Includes a few extra folders that are not needed but leaving them here for future use.

Will make other repositories for further development, leaving this unchanged to be used as a starting point.

See Gradle: ng_dummy_ng.net.neoforged:neoforge:version# in external libraries for Neo documentation.
